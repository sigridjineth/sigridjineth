### Sigrid Jin (sigridjin.eth)

üëã Hi! Welcome to my GitHub place for those who pass by as a stranger or my acquiantance.

I am a junior-level software engineer specializing in web backend and core engineering (but not limited to), pursuing a foundation in mathematics degree in college degree program in Seoul, South Korea. My keen interest in large language model (LLM) system architecture and developing zero-knowledge (ZK) circuits sets me apart using Golang and Rust.

In addition to the technical prowess, I enjoy writing educational materials and engaging in public speaking and technical writing to help fellow developers gain an understanding of software concepts.

```golang
type sigridjin_eth struct {
	github        GitHub
	email         Email
	twitter       Twitter
	linkedIn      LinkedIn
	TechStack     []Technology
	student       []School
}

func (s *sigridjin_eth) NewSigridJinEth() *sigridjin_eth {
	return *sigridjin_eth{
		github:    GitHub{"sigridjin_eth"},
		email: 	   Email{"sigrid.jinhyung@gmail.com"},

### üî≠ Philosophy
* Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and Proof of Concepts (PoCs) are some of the quickest ways to make ideas more tangible and to experiment with new technologies (relatively speaking).
